Good day!

I have used React JS on frontend and PHP on backend in creating my CRUD Application


*First is import "react_php_crud.sql" that serves as database on http://localhost/phpmyadmin

*Move the folder "php-react" on D:\xampp\htdocs or wherever your xampp folder is located.

*Then you can run the app on Visual Studio Code

Thank you.
